# EasyRecord
Shorthand Core Data tool

In fact this tool is extension category for standard Core Data classes. It will allow you to more easily perform typical standard operations: creating context, queries, filters and so on. Also this tool elaborate for easily create a core data storage in memory.

# Usage

Just include main header `#import "FAEasyRecord.h"` file into your code, and then:

__Init core data stack in memory__

`[FAEasyRecord setupCoreDataStackWithInMemoryStore];`

__Save some data__

```objectivec

NSDictionary *data = //some dict data
[FAEasyRecord saveWithBlock:^(NSManagedObjectContext *localContext){
    [FEMDeserializer objectFromRepresentation:data
                                      mapping:[SomeManagedObject defaultMapping]
                                      context:localContext];
}
completion:^(BOOL contextDidSave, NSError *error){
          // some completion there
}];
```

__Find some data__

```objectivec

NSPredicate *predicate = [NSPredicate predicateWithFormat:@"%K == %@", MyManagedObjectRelationships.otherData, data];
NSFetchedResultsController *frc = [MyManagedObject ER_fetchAllGroupedBy:@"count"
			                                                   withPredicate:predicate
									                                            sortedBy:MyManagedObjectAttributes.uid
                                                             ascending:YES
                                                              delegate:self];
  NSArray *result = frc.fetchedObjects;

```

Also for that tool we recommend use [mogenerator tool](https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator).
